\section{How do I change the labelleds of links?}

The  of links can be changed to your liking using:

{\small\verb!\hypersetup{url=red}!}, or

{\small\verb!\hypersetup{cite=green}!}, or

{\small\verb!\hypersetup{all=blue}!}.

\noindent If you want to completely hide the links, you can use:

{\small\verb!\hypersetup{alls=.}!}, or even better:

{\small\verb!\hypersetup{hidelinks}!}.

\noindent If you want to have obvious links in the PDF but not the printed text, use:

{\small\verb!\hypersetup{links=false}!}.
