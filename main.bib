    abstract = {In this paper we describe two Propositional Satisﬁability-based algorithms for solving 0-1 integer linear programs (ILP). The algorithms are speciﬁcally targeted at ILP instances that are highly constrained, i.e. instances for which the constraints are hard to satisfy. The two algorithms are based on recent algorithms for solving instances of Propositional Satisﬁability (SAT) which are also highly constrained. In particular we illustrate how the algorithms for solving ILPs can be improved with search pruning techniques commonly used in SAT algorithms. The usefulness of the proposed algorithms is illustrated on a practical application for which instances are in general highly constrained.},

It is known that, when restricted to formulas having only two literals per clause, this problem has an efficient (polynomial-time) solution. But the same problem on formulas having three literals per clause is NP-complete, and hence probably does not have any efficient solution. In this paper, we consider an infinite class of satisfiability problems which contains these two particular problems as special cases, and show that every member of this class is either polynomial-time decidable or NP-complete. The infinite collection of new NP-complete problems so obtained may prove very useful in finding other new NP-complete problems. The classification of the polynomial-time decidable cases yields new problems that are complete in polynomial time and in nondeterministic log space. We also consider an analogous class of problems, involving quantified formulas, which has the property that every member is either polynomialtime decidable or complete in polynomial space.},

It is reasonable to consider such a problem satisfactorily solved when an algorithm for its solution is found which terminates within a number of steps bounded by a polynomial in the length of the input. We show that a large number of classic unsolved problems of covering, matching, packing, routing, assignment and sequencing are equivalent, in the sense that either each of them possesses a polynomial-bounded algorithm or none of them does.},

    abstract = {We present a nondeterministic model of computation based on reversing edge directions in weighted directed graphs with minimum in-flow constraints on vertices. Deciding whether this simple graph model can be manipulated in order to reverse the direction of a particular edge is shown to be {PSPACE}-complete by a reduction from Quantified Boolean Formulas. We prove this result in a variety of special cases including planar graphs and highly restricted vertex configurations, some of which correspond to a kind of passive constraint logic. Our framework is inspired by (and indeed a generalization of) the ``Generalized Rush Hour Logic'' developed by Flake and Baum. We illustrate the importance of our model of computation by giving simple reductions to show that several motion-planning problems are {PSPACE}-hard. Our main result along these lines is that classic unrestricted sliding-block puzzles are {PSPACE}-hard, even if the pieces are restricted to be all dominoes (1x2 blocks) and the goal is simply to move a particular piece. No prior complexity results were known about these puzzles. This result can be seen as a strengthening of the existing result that the restricted Rush Hour puzzles are {PSPACE}-complete, of which we also give a simpler proof. Finally, we strengthen the existing result that the pushing-blocks puzzle Sokoban is {PSPACE}-complete, by showing that it is {PSPACE}-complete even if no barriers are allowed.},

This allows us to improve upon existing results obtained by reduction from {NCL}.

First we show that this problem is {PSPACE}-complete, even for planar graphs of maximum degree 3 and just six colors. Then we consider the problem restricted to trees. We show that any list edge-coloring can be transformed into any other under the sufficient condition that the number of allowed colors for each edge is strictly larger than the degrees of both its endpoints. This sufficient condition is best possible in some sense. Our proof yields a polynomial-time algorithm that finds a transformation between two given list edge-colorings of a tree with n vertices using O(n2) recolor steps. This worst-case bound is tight: we give an infinite family of instances on paths that satisfy our sufficient condition and whose reconfiguration requires \$Ømega\$(n2) recolor steps.},

	abstract = {We present a polynomial-time algorithm that, given two independent sets in a claw-free graph \$G\$, decides whether one can be transformed into the other by a sequence of elementary steps. Each elementary step is to remove a vertex \$v\$ from the current independent set \$S\$ and to add a new vertex \$w\$ (not in \$S\$) such that the result is again an independent set. We also consider the more restricted model where \$v\$ and \$w\$ have to be adjacent.},

	abstract = {A vertex-subset graph problem \$Q\$ defines which subsets of the vertices of an input graph are feasible solutions. The reconfiguration version of a vertex-subset problem \$Q\$ asks whether it is possible to transform one feasible solution for \$Q\$ into another in at most \${\textbackslash}ell\$ steps, where each step is a vertex addition or deletion, and each intermediate set is also a feasible solution for \$Q\$ of size bounded by \$k\$. Motivated by recent results establishing W[1]-hardness of the reconfiguration versions of most vertex-subset problems parameterized by \${\textbackslash}ell\$, we investigate the complexity of such problems restricted to graphs of bounded treewidth. We show that the reconfiguration versions of most vertex-subset problems remain {PSPACE}-complete on graphs of treewidth at most \$t\$ but are fixed-parameter tractable parameterized by \${\textbackslash}ell + t\$ for all vertex-subset problems definable in monadic second-order logic ({MSOL}). To prove the latter result, we introduce a technique which allows us to circumvent cardinality constraints and define reconfiguration problems in {MSOL}.},

In 2006, Gopalan et al. studied connectivity properties of the solution graph and related complexity issues for CSPs [GKMP09], motivated mainly by research on satisﬁability algorithms and the satisﬁability threshold. They proved dichotomies for the diameter of connected components and for the complexity of the st-connectivity question, and conjectured a trichotomy for the connectivity question.},
